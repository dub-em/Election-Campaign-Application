Step 1 - Install the Heroku CLI on your Computer (You can find the procedure here for all OS https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

You can skip this step if you already have Heroku installed on your computer.

Step 2 - Go to Heroku website (heroku.com), login and create a new App; choose a meaningful name for your App.

Step 3 - Now we need to add a python build path, head over to Settings>Add Build Path>Select the Python Option

Deploying Our Script
Before you can deploy an app to Heroku, you need to add Two Important Files which are the Procfile & requirements.txt file

Procfile Setup
Open your project in your favourite code Editor or Navigate to your project directory and create a file named Procfile

Next, using any code editor like VSCode or TextEdit, open the Profile, and replace any text already prevalent with:

web: python main.py
worker: python main.py

If you encounter any errors like app crash then remove "web python main.py"

Requirements.txt File Setup
The requirements.txt file makes it easier for Heroku to install the correct versions of the required Python libraries (or “packages”) to run your Python code.

We are going to tell Heroku packages to install using our requirements.txt

Open Your project folder On your Command Line Interface (CLI) inside your environment use the following command:

# install
pip3 install pipreqs

# Run in current directory
python3 -m  pipreqs.pipreqs

Deploying to Heroku
Now, it is time to deploy our python script to Heroku.

To do this, Open Your project folder On your Command Line Interface (CLI) inside your environment use the following command:

heroku login
heroku git:remote -a NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APP
git add .
git commit -m "Deployment commit"
git push heroku main

Running the App or bot on Heroku
This is the final step! Now in order to turn on/execute our script, we have to open up our app on the Heroku Website, go to Resources, and hit edit on our worker.

- Enable both the web and worker, then save.

Note: It can take up to two minutes for the script to start running!

If your app is still not working, on your Terminal, run:

heroku ps:scale worker=1
