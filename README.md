# Election-Campaign-Application

### Problem Statement
+ There is a significant disconnect between public office holders and the sentiment/complaints of the citizens they preside over, even in cases where the said public office holder or leader is willing to pay attention. This issue has been largely tackled in developed countries, but still remain a major hinderance in undeveloped countries.
+ This problem also makes it difficult for people in power to lead a people-driven development, rather they end up executing policies and project they believe best with little influence from what the citizens think.
+ This problem also leads to generic campaigns, when in reality different states or districts may have different problems to address. A generic campaign might work more in underdeveloped countries, but as these countries start to develop, these generalized approach starts to have diminishing returns.
+ This is but to mention a few, and will be expanded upon as the project gets scaled up.

### Purpose of this Project
